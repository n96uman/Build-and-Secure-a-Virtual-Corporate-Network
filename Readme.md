### 🧱 Step-by-Step Task Checklist
- ✅ = Complete
- 🔄 = In Progress
- ⏳ = Not Started

#### 📁 Step 1: Lab Setup

-  Install VirtualBox or VMware: ✅ Complete
    
-  Install Ubuntu Server ISO
    
-  Install Windows 10 ISO
    
-  Install Kali Linux ISO
    
-  Install pfSense ISO
    
-  Create and connect VMs on an internal network
    

#### 🌐 Step 2: Network Design

-  Assign static IPs or set up DHCP on pfSense
    
-  Set up DNS configuration (optional)
    
-  Verify connectivity between all machines
    
-  Diagram network topology
    

#### 🔧 Step 3: Core Services Configuration

-  Set up Apache or Nginx web server
    
-  Create basic login form (PHP/HTML or Django)
    
-  Create users (Linux or Windows or AD)
    
-  Set up DNS or DHCP (optional)
    

#### 🛡️ Step 4: Network Hardening

-  Install & configure pfSense firewall
    
-  Block unused ports
    
-  Install Snort or Suricata IDS
    
-  Write basic detection rules (e.g., ping sweep)
    
-  Harden Ubuntu (disable services, update packages)
    
-  Harden Windows (user policies, services)
    

#### 🧪 Step 5: Attack Simulation & Testing

-  Scan the network with `nmap` from Kali
    
-  Try brute-force attack with `hydra`
    
-  Try XSS or SQLi on your login page
    
-  Review pfSense and Snort alerts
    
-  Capture traffic with `Wireshark`
    

#### 📝 Step 6: Documentation & Report

-  Create network diagram (draw.io or hand-drawn)
    
-  Document system setup steps
    
-  Add screenshots of configuration & alerts
    
-  Write security analysis (risks, protections)
    
-  Create README report or PDF final report
